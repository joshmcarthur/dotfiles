# Often an IP address may be required to bind to an interface,
# manage some configuration, connect to services etc.
#
# If you move between many networks, then your IP is something that
# might be quite unknown to you - this command provides a simple
# way of discovering what your current IP is.
#
# This tool is especially handy if you work in a team environment where
# you might be a co-worker to check out your copy of an application to
# help diagnose an issue, etc.
